/// Lazy stacks share the layout behavior of their non-lazy counterparts in a way
/// that they have the size of the union of their subviews. However, they
/// don't try to distribute the available size among their subviews. Instead,
/// they just propose `nil x proposedHeight` (or `proposedWidth x nil`) to their
/// subviews,which means that their subviews become their ideal width (or height).
