/// `Spacer` views accept any proposed size when they are not in a stack view.
/// However, when they are in a stack view, their behavior changes. In a vertical
/// stack, it  accepts any height from its minimum height to infinity but
/// reports zero width. In a horizontal stack, it is the same, just the other way
/// around. The minimum length of the `Spacer` is the length of the default padding,
/// unless specified in its initializer.
struct SpacerContentView: View {
    /// Instead of using a `Spacer`, it is recommended to use a flexible frame
    /// modifier with alignment. The reason is that the `Spacer` has a default
    /// minimum length. Thus, the text might start wrapping or truncating sooner
    /// than necessary, because the `Spacer` also occupies some of the proposed
    /// width of the HStack.
